These two folders contain the manufacturing and assembly documentation I produced when I had my circuit board printed and assembled.
Some of the files might need to be downloaded to be viewed such as the Project_1.pdf file which shows the 3D model of my PCB on Adobe. 
However, most of the files should be readily visible upon the initial click to view the file.
